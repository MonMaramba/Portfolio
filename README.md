#The Objectives

1. This project is a part of my coursework requirements for the UC Berkeley Extension Coding Bootcamp. Its is a collection of my projects and homework. 

1. I aimed to present my portfolio in a very non-traditional way through the use of hexagon shaped images arranged in a honeycomb pattern while still maintaining mobile responsiveness.

1. The links to the code is presented separately as I couldn't find a way to set up 2 links in 1 image without drastically altering the look and feel of the website.



##User Notes

1. This will be deployed and hopefully, it will have some entertainment value. It will be more to highlight what I've learned so far.

1. Please let me know if you have comments on how to make this app better or if you notice some bugs.

1. I would like to learn how to code better and if there's a better way of doing things, please don't hesitate to show me... and kindly explain to me as if I was a 12 year old :)

1. I am not expecting anybody needing help running this eventually but just in case, email monmaramba@yahoo.com.
